                    Taylor was born into a family of eclectic visual artists in the Florida Panhandle. He grew up inside of his family’s advertising agency where he quickly developed a love for web development, multimedia design, and information technology. When he was twelve years-old, he served as assistant teacher in the Kids on Campus’ web development class at Northwest Florida State College.

                    After graduating high school as a homeschooler, Taylor began working as an independent website consultant and moved to the West coast to seek new learning opportunities. During his time in Washington state, Taylor studied permaculture design science for two years on a biodynamic farm, served the local community by cooking meals for a mental health organization, and enrolled in Central Washington University’s Information Technology & Administrative Management program.

                    For fun, Taylor enjoys working as a singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist in several music projects, cooking big pots of gumbo, and spending time out on the water. He is most passionate about creative communication, meeting new people, travelling, and finding innovative ways to connect with people.
